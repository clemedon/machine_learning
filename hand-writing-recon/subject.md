##  The task

###     Definition

You need to classify a collection of handwrittend digits in each
category they belong to.

###     Data

You need to use one of scikit-learn model for clasifying MNIST dataset.

The **MNIST** dataset is a collection of handwritten digits, as shown
by the below picture:

Geoffrey Hinton has described it as "The **drosphilia** of machine
learning", meaning that it enables machine learning researchers to
study their algorithms in controlled laboratory conditions, much as
biologists often study fruit flies.

###     Model

For the model, you can choose *any of scikit-learn models* for this
task.

If you already feel confortable with some deeplearning frameworks, you
can use one, but you don't have to.

###     Results

You need to evaluate your model results.

##  What matters for this test

We want you to document your thought and research process.

There is a lot of different choices that you have to make to solve
this problem.

 - What *model* to use ?
 - Which *parameters* to give him ?
 - How to *evaluate* your results ?
 - ...

We want you to be aware of these choices, by *specifying them in a
markdown cell before your code block, and sourcing what motivated*
your choice.

It can be:
 - as simple as a link to an online tutorial found from a google
   search like `sklearn MNIST classification tutorial`
 - as complex as a citation from a relevant research paper
 - as adventurous as a conclusion from your own benchmark

It should be easy for someone discovering your notebook to read and
understand your work.

###     Submiting your work

Fill the notebook ```Subject.ipynb```

Before submitting us back your notebook, vertify that we will be able
to run *without errors if we run it from the first cell to the last
one*.
